## Using `nvm` + [Bamboo](https://www.atlassian.com/software/bamboo):
When installing `node` on a Bamboo server, nvm should be installed locally using the previous install instructions. As described in the [Service Installation section](#service), each Node.js app should contain a `.nvmrc` file that indicates the _version_ or [Node.js codename](https://github.com/nodejs/Release/blob/master/CODENAMES.md) that will be used by Bamboo. The [`nvmrc.sh` script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ugate/node-help/master/nvmrc.sh) can be used to dynamically detect and install the node version used by an app based upon the project's `.nvmrc` file. It will determine if the node version is already installed. When it is not, it will run the `nvm` command to install it.

Write the [`nvmrc.sh` script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ugate/node-help/master/nvmrc.sh) onto the __Bamboo server and the deployment servers__.
```sh
# write the nvmrc.sh contents from the nvmrc.sh script
sudo vi /opt/nvmrc.sh
# add execution privleges for all users
sudo chmod a+x /opt/nvmrc.sh
```

Now that the nvmrc.sh script has been written on both the Bamboo integration server and the deployment server(s), the Bamboo tasks can be setup.

### Build
There are a few build tasks that can be setup to handle automated Node.js builds in Bamboo. These tasks will accomplish the following goals:

1. Checkout the Node.js application code
1. Node.js install/update
1. Run the build operations such as npm, npx, etc.
1. Bundle the appication into a single compressed archive

#### Checkout the Node.js application code
The node app code should be checked out according to the branch where the build is taking place.

#### Install Node.js &amp; Build Operations
Check the Node.js version that is required by the app based upon the `.nvmrc` file in the base directory of the app. Based upon the extracted Node.js version the build task will install or update the specified Node.js version if it isn't already installed. For example, if `.nvmrc` contains `lts/erbium` the build script will ensure the latest `12.x` version of node is installed/used during subsequent `node`/`npm`/`mpx` calls.

```sh
# set the NVM_DIR (if not already set)
export NVM_DIR=/opt/.nvm
# ensure desired node version is installed using .nvmrc in base dir of app
/opt/nvmrc.sh
# run node commands using app version in .nvmrc (exec may vary)
echo 'node version:' && $NVM_DIR/nvm-exec node -v
echo 'npm version:' && $NVM_DIR/nvm-exec npm -v
$NVM_DIR/nvm-exec npm ci
$NVM_DIR/nvm-exec npm run unit
$NVM_DIR/nvm-exec npx snowpack
```

> Depending on the size of the application, the `NODE_OPTIONS="--max-old-space-size=2048"` memory may need to be set on the Environment variables

#### Bundle the application
Create an single archive that can easily deployed to various server environments.

```sh
tar --exclude='./*git*' --exclude='./node_modules' --exclude='*.gz' -czvf myapp.tar.gz *
```

### Deploy
Once the deployment is triggered, there are a few tasks that can be perfoemed to ensure the vertically/horizontally scalled node app is updated and restarted

1. Clean the working directory
1. Download the compressed node app
1. SSH: Stop the node app service target &amp; Node.js install/update
1. SSH: Backup the node app dir and clean it's contents
1. SCP: Copy compressed node app artifact to the deployment server(s)
1. SSH: Extract node app artifact
1. SSH: Start the node app service target

#### Clean the working directory
Ensure that the working deployment directory doesn't contain any files/directories from prior deployments

#### Download the compressed node app
Download the compressed node app directories from the CI server onto the deployment server(s)

<kbd>![Deploy Task 2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ugate/node-help/master/img/bamboo-deploy-task2.jpg "Deploy Task 2")</kbd>

#### Stop the node app service target &amp; Node.js install/update
In order to update the previously built node app, the service target needs to be stopped. Also, check the Node.js version that is required by the app based upon the `.nvmrc` file in the base directory of the app. Based upon the extracted Node.js version the build task will install or update the specified Node.js version if it isn't already installed. For example, if `.nvmrc` contains `lts/erbium` the build script will ensure the latest `12.x` version of node is installed/used during subsequent `node`/`npm`/`mpx` calls.

```sh
# stop Node.js app service
sudo systemctl stop myapp.target
# ensure desired node version is installed using .nvmrc in base dir of app
/opt/nvmrc.sh /opt/apps/myapp
```

#### Backup the node app dir and clean it's contents
Before extracting the updated node app, the old app version should be backed up and timestamped before continuing. Once backed up, the old contents should be removed.

```sh
tar -czvf /tmp/myapp-backup-`date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S`.tar.gz /opt/apps/myapp/*
rm -rf /opt/apps/myapp/*
```

#### Copy compressed node app artifact to the deployment server(s)
Copy the updated node app archive from the CI server onto the deployment server(s).

<kbd>![Deploy Task 5](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ugate/node-help/master/img/bamboo-deploy-task5.jpg "Deploy Task 5")</kbd>

#### Extract node app artifact
Extract the compressed node app that contains the updates into the existing application directory.

```sh
tar --warning=no-timestamp -xzvf /opt/apps/myapp/myapp.tar.gz -C /opt/apps/myapp
rm -f /opt/apps/myapp/myapp.tar.gz
```

<kbd>![Deploy Task 6](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ugate/node-help/master/img/bamboo-deploy-task6.jpg "Deploy Task 6")</kbd>

#### Start the node app service target
Start the node app service target which will start all of the underlying service instances.

```sh
# start node app services
sudo systemctl start myapp.target
sudo systemctl status myapp.target
```

### Troubleshooting

Troubleshooting can be performed on the integration/Bamboo server itself using ssh and executing the subsequent commands.

```sh
# remote login using svc_admin and switch user with root access
sudo su
# switch user to bamboo
su bamboo
# change dir to the (captured from the first few lines of the build log)
cd /opt/application-data/bamboo/xml-data/build-dir/MYAPP-MASTER-JOB1
# bamboo sets these env vars when it runs, so we need to add them manually here
PATH=$PATH:/opt/.nvm/versions/node/v14.0.0/bin
# init build
/opt/.nvm/versions/node/v14.0.0/bin/npm ci
# init packaging?
/opt/.nvm/versions/node/v14.0.0/bin/npx snowpack install
# run app?
node .
```
